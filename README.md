# Connect-4

Implementation of the famous game Connect 4 with an UI and AI


I did my first Connect 4 when I was in Hight School. </br>
I upgraded it during the [HM40](https://github.com/galyfray/HM40) project, also available on GitHub.


Today, the new version is developping ! </br>
I am improving the UI and add a version where we can play against an AI.
